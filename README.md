This is V Harikrishna of IT branch VIT.
I have created a Discord bot with respect to requirements given by VIT GDSC in thier task sheet.

Features of the bot include:-
AI Chat:
Non-command messages and the "!chat" command forward your message to the Gemini API to generate and return an AI-powered response.

Reminders:
Users can create, list, modify, and delete personal reminders. The bot checks reminders in the background and sends you a direct message (DM) when a reminder is due.

Polls:
Easily create polls with the "!poll" command. The bot automatically adds numbered reactions for voting.

I have used the following libraries:-
asyncio
discord
datetime
collections
google.generativeai 
os
